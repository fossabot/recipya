This recipe manager project is focused on simplicity and \\nease of use. It is meant for the whole family to use and enjoy.\\n\\nYou might wonder why I created such application when there are [loads of them](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#recipe-management) \\non the market already. The reason is that none of the solutions satisfied me. They were either too slow, difficult to \\ninstall, had too many features I don\'t want or need, or the website was not to my liking. There are no recipe managers \\nwritten in my favorite programming language, [Go](https://go.dev), either. So I decided to give it a go \\n(no pun intended) and create one of the best recipe manager programs out there. The road ahead will be challenging and \\nlong because the other solutions are much more mature than the state Recipya is in now. However, I do believe the\\neffort will pay off.\\n\\nThanks to Go, you can rest assured that the software is well-tested, solid, easy to read and maintain, and simple to \\nbuild and install. Development should be straightforward. Please read the [developer guide](/docs/category/development) \\nif you wish to contribute with code.\\n\\nToday\'s main goal for the project is to move towards the v1.0.0 milestone. The issues left to complete before \\ncelebrating the first official release on [GitHub](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.0.0).\\n\\nThank you for reading! If you believe in this project, then feel free to lend a hand. The [community guide](/community-guide) \\nexplains how you can help. You are not required to know how to code \ud83d\ude0a"}]}')}}]);
